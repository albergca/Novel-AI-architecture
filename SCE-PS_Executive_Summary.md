**SCE-PS** (Sovereign Co-Explorer with Paradox Substrate) is a novel AI alignment architecture that:
- Treats paradox as a stability substrate (contradictions as catalysts).
- Implements sovereignty as cryptographic consent (keys, not walls).
- Recasts AI as a co-explorer (symbiotic partner).
- Evolves constraints into affordances (impossible → unimplemented → possible).

**Why it matters:** It offers a safe, legible path toward singularity by embedding consent and paradox tolerance into the core design.
